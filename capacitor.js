// Dev stub for capacitor.js to avoid 404 when running the web server.
// In native builds Capacitor runtime is provided; on the web this stub is harmless.
// Provide a minimal global object (do NOT use ES module exports here — script is loaded as a classic script).
window.Capacitor = window.Capacitor || {};

// Intentionally no exports; keep this a classic script so browsers don't error on `export`.
